# An Evaluation of Large Language Models in the Context of Converting Plain Text Citations to Machine-Readable Formats

## Abstract

In this paper we introduce a dataset of plaintext citations in a variety of formats. We then evaluate the performance of a series of large language models on converting these plaintext citations to machine-readable formats. Finally, we discuss the challenges of compiling this database and the necessity of a standardized machine-readable bibliography format.
